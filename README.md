## PSTools
This project creates protein sequence coverage maps from peptide data. 
## Keywords
proteomics, biopharmaceutical analysis, mass spectrometry, ggplot2, protein sequence coverage, heatmap, geom_tile()
## Expanded Description
The goal is to visualize which peptide in a given protein have been identified, and at which frequency. 
The function is plot.hetmap.peptide and has two arguments. 
1) a data frame that has one of it's columns named "peptides", which contains the sequence of the identified peptides 
2) the full sequence of the target protein as a character vecor
The function returns a heatmap created with ggplot2 (geom_tile).
## Usage
